## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to various electronics projects I've worked on. The goal is to share knowledge, provide resources, and help others replicate and learn from these projects. Each project includes all necessary files and detailed instructions.

## Projects

### DS18B20 Temperature Sensor Project

**Description**: This project demonstrates how to use the DS18B20 temperature sensor with an ESP32 to create a web-based interface for monitoring temperature data. The data is stored in a MySQL database, and the interface displays the data in real-time.

**Components Used**:
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- ESP32
- MySQL Database
- PHP for backend scripting
- HTML/CSS for the web interface

**Files Included**:
- `fetch_temperature.php`: Script to fetch temperature data from the database
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the web interface
- `Temp.php`: Script to handle temperature data processing
- `userinterface.php`: Main interface script to display the data
- `DS18B20.ino`: Arduino code for the ESP32 to read and send data
