# ESP32 Controlling a 12V DC Water Pump

In this project, we demonstrate how to control a 12V DC water pump using the ESP32 microcontroller. This project makes use of a relay module to switch the water pump on and off, enabling you to automate tasks such as irrigation, water supply, and more.

## Components Used
- **ESP32**: Main microcontroller responsible for controlling the pump.
- **12V DC Water Pump**: A small pump powered by a 12V DC supply.
- **Relay Module**: Used to control the 12V pump through the ESP32.
- **12V Power Adapter**: Supplies power to the water pump.

## Features
- Control the water pump remotely using the ESP32.
- Easily modify the code to incorporate other sensors or modules.
- Example application in automated irrigation systems or water control setups.

## How It Works
- The ESP32 sends control signals to the relay module, which in turn activates or deactivates the water pump.
- A simple switch is simulated in the Arduino code, which can be controlled manually or automatically using environmental triggers (e.g., soil moisture sensors).

## Arduino Code
The code for the ESP32 is included in the repository. You can find it [here](https://github.com/MaliusMartin/MiniProjects-Electronincs/blob/main/12V%20DC%20Pump/Pump.ino).

## Usage Instructions
1. Wire up the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the ESP32.
3. Power up the 12V DC water pump using a 12V power adapter.
4. Control the water pump using the ESP32, either manually or through automated triggers.
